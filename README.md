# Stress-CMR-and-EHR-Outcome-Prediction

This is an example of electronic health records (EHR) modelling for outcome prediction (mortality and ventricular arrhythmia) using conventional statistics with Cox model, then training different machine learning models (SVM, RF, XGBoost) to predict mortality outcome and comparing it with linear regression. 
The sample codes are not exclusive, but they give some starting points to explore EHR data using machine learning. 

The prediction variables are a mixture of clinical and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) reports data.
