# Stress-CMR-and-EHR-Outcome-Prediction

This is an example of electronic health records (EHR) modelling for outcome prediction (mortality and ventricular arrhythmia) using conventional statistics with Cox model, then using different machine learning models (SVM, RF, etc) and a trial of MLP to predict the binary outcome. 
The sample codes are not exclusive, but they give some starting points to explore EHR data using machine learning. 

The prediction variables are a mixture of clinical and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) reports data.
