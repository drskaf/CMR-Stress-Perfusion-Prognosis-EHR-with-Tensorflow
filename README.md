# Stress-CMR-and-EHR-Outcome-Prediction

This is an exmaple of electronic health records (EHR) modelling for outcome prediction (mortality or ventricular arrhythmia) using conventional statistics with Cox model, then using classical machine learning models (SVM, RF, etc) and a trial of MLP to predict the binary outcome. 
The sample codes are not exclusive, but they give some starting points to explore EHR data using machine learning. 

The prediction variables are mixed of clinical and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) reports data.
